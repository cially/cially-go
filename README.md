## 🐠 How it works
Cially Dashboard is powered by a Discord Bot, a full-stack Next.js application, and Pocketbase as the backend. The Discord Bot actively listens to all events happening on your server and logs them to the database via its own API.
The web application then retrieves this data from the database to display detailed insights and information to the user. Since the database stores data using IDs (for users, channels, etc.), the website communicates directly with the bot to resolve these IDs into human-readable names and to fetch the most up-to-date information on demand.
All ongoing synchronization and data enrichment—such as resolving names or syncing recent activity—is handled seamlessly between the bot and the website.

## 🪸 How to run
### Initial Setup
1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new Application
2. Go to `Bot` Section and enable all the of `Privileged Gateway Intents` as shown in the picture bellow

3. Invite the Bot to your Discord Server
4. Give it permissions to `View Channel` & `View Message History` on every channel you want the bot to track
> [!TIP]
> **OPTIONAL** Give the bot `Manage Server` permission if you want it to track Vanity URL Uses
5. Once you got PocketBase up and running, go to Settings -> Import -> Load from JSON file

6. Upload the pb_schema json file that can be found in the `/pocketbase` directory
7. Review Changes and then apply them
> [!WARNING]  
> Do not change anything in the database if you don't know what you are doing! Changing a small detail might break the dashboard

### Docker Setup
1. Download or copy the [docker-compose.yaml](./docker-compose.yaml) file from the repository.
2. (Optional) Ensure the `pb_migrations` directory is located at `./pocketbase/pb_migrations` relative to the `docker-compose.yaml` file on your host machine. This directory will be mounted to `/pocketbase/pb_migrations` inside the container to automatically create the needed collections.
3. Edit the docker-compose.yaml file and replace the environment variables with your own values.
4. Run `docker compose up -d` to start the services.
5. Make sure to follow the initial setup instructions regarding Pocketbase/Discord Bot Setup.
6. Success! The dashboard should be up and running! Make sure to let the bot store some data first before checking your servers! 

### Manual Setup
#### Pocketbase Instance
1. Install [Pocketbase 0.26.0](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases/tag/v0.26.6)
2. Run `./pocketbase serve` to start the backend
3. Open the URL displayed on your terminal and create an admin account
4. Then follow the *Initial Setup* instructions that can be found above

#### Discord Bot
1. Clone the `/cially-bot` directory where you want the Bot Code to run on.
2. Rename `.env.example` file to `.env` and replace each value. There are instructions for each variable so you will know what to change
4. Make sure to follow the *Initial Setup* instructions that can be found above

#### Website
1. Clone the `./cially-webserver` directory where you want the Website Code to run on
2. Rename `.env.example` file to `.env` and replace each value. There are instructions for each variable so you will know what to change
3. Run `npm run build` to build the website. 

> [!TIP]
> If you are using a VPS (or any other kind of machine to run all the services 24/7) you should use Docker for easier setup. Manual installation is not really suggested for beginners.

And that's it! Once a new message is being detected by the bot for the first time, everything should start to work automatically! All you need to do is go to your Dashboard Page, paste your Server ID and all the data will be displayed!

> [!CAUTION]
> Only the events that happened while the bot is up and running are being tracked and displayed on the dashboard! Older events (such as older messages) or events that happened while the bot was offline for whatever reason are NOT being tracked. Therefore, the data will be inaccurate unless the bot is running without any downtimes 24/7
